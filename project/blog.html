                <h2>Encounters in the wild!</h2>
                <p>Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States. We share these areas
                    with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find
                    yourself face to face with one.

                    Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless. There are,
                    however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be found
                    in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. The scorpion that calls
                    Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States.
                    Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily humans are not on
                    that list!

                    They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths, spiders and
                    other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be found with ice,
                    aspirin and time.

                    When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your shoes or
                    sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a scorpion
                    and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.

                    Big horn sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. It is one of two
                    species of wild sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur. Most
                    weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that helps them detect and avoid
                    predators.

                    Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are short with a
                    slight curvature. Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting.

                    If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 100 feet
                    away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.</p>
